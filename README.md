The maximum amount per day and vehicle is 60 SEK.

Congestion tax is charged for vehicles passing through a toll from Monday to Friday between 06:00 and 18:29.

Tax is NOT levied on Saturdays, public holidays, days before public holidays or during the month of July.

Some vehicles are exempt from congestion tax.

A vehicle that passes multiple toll booths within 60 minutes is only taxed once. The amount to be paid in that case is the highest amount among those passages.
